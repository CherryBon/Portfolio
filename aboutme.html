<div class="box1"><p>This is what I firmly believe in: The results of the efforts I make today may not be seen for a long time, but I believe that everything I do will count towards their outcome in the end. </p>
<p>My name is Cherry Bon, and I'm a persistent person with a goal and a vision that drives me to learn more about the industry I work in. I rarely let other people's opinions affect my decisions. I have a strong sense of who I am, which enables me to go on without being influenced by what others think of me. </p> <p>I'm dedicated to lifelong learning because I think it will require time, effort, acquiring new skills, and making wise judgments/decisions to achieve my goals in life. I have a strong desire to learn because I think that learning is a never-ending process that does not finish with a given age or stage of life.</p>
